# Violet Evergarden
**Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised to be a deadly weapon on the battlefield. Hospitalized and maimed in a bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from the person she held dearest, but no understanding of their meaning. Recovering from her wounds, Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services. There, she witnesses by pure chance the work of an "Auto Memory Doll", amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Moved by the notion, Violet begins work as an Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure, one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery.**

**Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece that will make you feel once again through its brilliant storytelling and excellent presentation of emotions. The story revolves around our protagonist, Violet Evergarden, and her adventures of learning to understand others' emotions as well as her own. Violet Evergarden is beautifully crafted in many senses. The emotional ups-and-downs that Violet experiences are truly touching and sincere, almost as if one was there by her side sympathising with her. Emotions throughout the series are displayed with a sense of truth and sincerity, hence making the story profoundly beautiful. Despite her unfortunate background and differences, there were still many kind individuals around her who continued to support her, befriend her, and even help her when she needed it the most. The story tugs at the heartstrings that many of us have long forgotten due to our extended lack of exposure to impactful content such as Violet Evergarden. Every story they have to offer is packed with emotional content and presented alluringly, which brings me to my next point - visuals**
